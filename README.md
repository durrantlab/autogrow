AutoGrow 3.1 is an evolutionary algorithm that optimizes candidate ligands for
predicted binding affinity and other druglike properties. Though no substitute
for the medicinal chemist, AutoGrow attempts to introduce some chemical
intuition into the automated optimization process. By carefully crafting
chemically feasible druglike molecules, we hope that AutoGrow 3.1 will help
supplement the chemist's efforts.
